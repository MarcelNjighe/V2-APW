                      Project Proposal Summary

We're going to be developing a Quiz Web Application. Our goal is to build a quiz web app that can be accessed, to practice free sample multiple choice questions. As the semester progresses, we will look to incorporate new ideas to the quiz app and make it a multiple page quiz taking system.

Our aim for this application is to open up questions when an individual clicks the start button and at the end it will post the score(Questions gotten right) of that particular individual with the total number of questions they took.

                        Git Workflow
We will be using a public repository in this project. With a masters branch consisting of fully ready content files, a default centralized git workflow that each individual will work off of by cloning a repository. Then we will commit and push to our development branch, which will at the end get merged with the master. So individually when we're working on the sections of code, we will post and collaborate to make sure the functionality are working properly.
