            <h3>POLICY </h3>
            <p>Rowan is an academic community and as such has instituted this Code to set forth standards and expectations consistent with its purpose as 
              an educational institution. The University reaffirms the principle of student freedom, coupled with an acceptance of full responsibility for 
              one's behavior and the consequences of such behavior. Rowan recognizes the rights of its students guaranteed by the Constitutions of the 
              United States and the State of New Jersey.</p>
            <p class="rules">
            <h3>Rowan Global  </h3>
            <p>Rowan students in online or hybrid courses must also meet the "conduct" expectations as listed at www.rowanonline.com. Students participating 
            in off-site Rowan Global Extension programs will also be expected to follow the guidelines provided by that facility. 
            Questions should be directed to the Office of the Associate Director, Office of Graduate Studies, Division of Global Learning & Partnerships at global@rowan.edu.</p>
